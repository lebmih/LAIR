Long Antibody Inserts Research.

Welcome to AG de la Rosa coding repository!
Keep it clean and smooth and nobody will get hurt!
Later I will add some guidelines for coding =)

What to do:
Download the table, take a look at the issues and fix them. It's a constant fight against entropy, we'll never run out of issues!

Issues:
If you found something wrong in the table (it can be anything, from misspelling to biologically unrealistic event) - push an issue! Please include: entry id (insert_id with run_id and donor_id), description of the problem and (optional) graphical explanation.
