Long Antibody Inserts Research.

Welcome to AG de la Rosa coding repository!
Keep it clean and smooth and nobody will get hurt!
Later I will add some guidelines for coding =)

What to do:
Download the table, take a look at the issues and fix them. It's a constant fight against entropy, we'll never run out of issues!

Issues:
If you found something wrong in the table (it can be anything, from misspelling to biologically unrealistic event) - push an issue! Please include: entry id (insert_id with run_id and donor_id), description of the problem and (optional) graphical explanation.

# ATTENTION!
The table containing the inserts+ contigs is not present in this folder! For security reasons the latest version is in AGdelaRosa\DATA\DataFrames (I don't believe anyone can steal data from the private repo, but who knows? nobody knows).
